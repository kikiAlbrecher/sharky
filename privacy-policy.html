            <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Relevant Legal Bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR
                on
                which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national
                data
                protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or establishment. In individual
                cases,
                we will inform you of any more specific legal bases that are applicable in the privacy policy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given
                    consent
                    to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is
                    necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party,
                    provided
                    that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not override the
                    protection
                    of personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Austria:</strong> In addition to the GDPR provisions,
                national regulations apply in Austria, especially the Federal Act for the Protection of Natural Persons
                in
                the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act – DSG). The Data Protection Act contains specific
                regulations regarding the right of access, rectification or deletion rights, processing of special
                categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, transmission, and automated decision-making
                in
                individual cases.</p>
            <p><strong>Note on the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG):</strong> This privacy
                notice serves both as information under the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG) and under the GDPR.
                Therefore,
                we kindly ask you to note that for clarity and broader geographical application, we use the terms of the
                GDPR. Specifically, the terms "processing" of "personal data", "legitimate interest", and "special
                categories of data" used in the GDPR are used instead of those in the Swiss DSG, such as "handling" of
                "personal data", "overriding interest", and "sensitive personal data". However, the legal meaning of
                these
                terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss DSG in the context of its applicability.</p>
            <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that data is transferred or disclosed to other
                entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of the data
                may
                include service providers engaged with IT tasks or providers of services and content integrated into a
                website. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and conclude appropriate contracts or
                agreements
                with the recipients of your data to protect your data.</p>
            <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
            <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying
                consents are withdrawn or no further legal basis for processing exists. This applies to cases where the
                original purpose of processing no longer exists or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this
                rule
                exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.</p>
            <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose retention is necessary
                for
                legal prosecution or the protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived
                accordingly.</p>
            <p>Our privacy policy contains additional information about the retention and deletion of data that applies
                specifically to certain processing operations.</p>
            <p>In the case of multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a given data, the longest period will
                apply.</p>
            <p>If a retention period does not explicitly begin on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it will
                automatically start at the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred. In the case
                of
                ongoing contractual relationships, where data is stored, the triggering event is the effective date of
                termination or the other termination of the legal relationship.</p>
            <p>Data that is no longer used for the originally intended purpose but is retained due to legal requirements
                or
                other reasons will only be processed for the purposes that justify its retention.</p>

                    request the transmission of such data to another controller, in accordance with legal requirements.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority:</strong> Without prejudice to any

                    (e.g.,
                    to prevent server overloads, especially in the case of malicious attacks such as DDoS attacks), and
                    also
                    to ensure the stability of the servers and their performance; <strong>Legal Grounds:</strong>
                    Legitimate
                    interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Logfile information is stored for
                    a
                    maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data that must be retained for evidentiary

                    will be exempt from deletion until the respective incident is resolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Sending and Hosting:</strong> The web hosting services we use also include sending,

                    the
                    respective emails, are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for spam detection.
                    Please note that emails are generally not encrypted when sent over the internet. Emails are
                    typically
                    encrypted during transmission, but (unless end-to-end encryption is used) are not encrypted on the
                    servers from which they are sent and received. Therefore, we cannot take responsibility for the
                    transmission of emails between the sender and the recipient on our server; <strong>Legal

            <h2 id="m136">Social Media Presences</h2>
            <p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context to communicate
                with
                users active there or to provide information about ourselves.</p>
            <p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may present
                risks
                for users, as it may make it more difficult to enforce user rights.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, user data within social networks is typically processed for market research and advertising
                purposes. For example, usage profiles may be created based on user behavior and resulting interests.
                These
                profiles may then be used to place advertisements both within and outside the networks, which presumably
                match the users' interests. Therefore, cookies are typically stored on users' devices, which store user
                behavior and interests. Moreover, data may be stored in user profiles regardless of the devices used
                (especially if users are members of the respective platforms and logged in there).</p>
            <p>For a detailed presentation of the respective processing forms and opt-out options, we refer to the
                privacy
                policies and notices of the operators of the respective networks.</p>
            <p>Even in the case of requests for information and the exercise of data subject rights, we would like to
                point
                out that these are most effectively addressed to the providers. Only they have access to the user data
                and
                can directly take the corresponding measures and provide information. Should you require assistance, you
                may

            <p>We integrate functional and content elements into our online services that are sourced from the servers
                of
                their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may include
                graphics,
                videos, or maps (collectively referred to as "content").</p>
            <p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of these contents process the users' IP
                address, as they would not be able to send the content to the users' browsers without an IP address.
                Therefore, the IP address is required for the display of these contents or functions. We strive to use
                only
                such content for which the respective providers apply the IP address only for the delivery of the
                content.
                Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web
                beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. Through these pixel tags, information such as visitor
                traffic on the pages of this website can be evaluated. The pseudonymous information can also be stored
                in
                cookies on the users' devices and may contain technical information about the browser and operating
                system,
                referring websites, visit times, and further details about the use of our online services, but may also
                be
                linked to information from other sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes on legal basis:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers,
                the
                legal basis for data processing is the granted permission. Otherwise, user data is processed based on
                our
                legitimate interests (i.e., the interest in efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly services). In

                    email communication, call logs, social network messages, and chat histories, including the involved
                    persons, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describes the processes and workflows
                    within systems or organizations, including workflow documentation, transaction logs, and audit logs
                    used
                    for tracking and verifying operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage data refers to information that tracks how users interact with
                    digital products, services, or platforms. This data includes a broad range of information that shows
                    how
                    users utilize applications, which features they prefer, how long they stay on specific pages, and
                    which
                    paths they navigate within an application. Usage data may also include the frequency of use,
                    activity
                    timestamps, IP addresses, device information, and location data. These data are particularly
                    valuable
                    for analyzing user behavior, optimizing user experiences, personalizing content, and improving
                    products
                    or services. Furthermore, usage data plays a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and
                    potential issues within digital offerings.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> "Personal data" refers to any information relating to an identified
                    or
                    identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as the "data subject"); a natural person is
                    considered identifiable if they can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference
                    to
                    an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, online identifier (e.g.,
                    cookie), or
                    to one or more specific characteristics that express the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
                    economic, cultural, or social identity of that person.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Log data are information about events or activities that are recorded in
                    a
                    system or network. These data typically include information such as timestamps, IP addresses, user
                    actions, error messages, and other details about the use or operation of a system. Log data are
                    often
                    used for analyzing system issues, monitoring security, or generating performance reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The "controller" is the natural or legal person, authority,
                    institution, or
